Exercise 2 

Planning to start with a different data set from the ONC
Once you determine the dataset you wish to use in this exercise, perform the following steps:
1. Reexecute your Exercise 1 script to load, clean, and analyze your dataset.
2. Consider how this data
could be used in a descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analysis.

a. Identify at least 2 investigative questions that could be answered through a
descriptive analysis of the dataset.
b. For each question, explain why you would want to know the answer to this
question.
c. For each question, explain how the answer leads to a diagnostic analysis
question.
d. For each question, describe the types of data transformation that would need to
take place (if any) to prepare the data for analysis.
e. For each question, identify the category of models (e.g. “a linear regression
model”) to answer the question.
f. For each question, justify your model selection.
5. Using complete sentences, fully complete the Diagnostic Analysis section with detailed
responses:
a. Identify at least 2 investigative questions that could be answered through a
diagnostic analysis of the dataset.
b. For each question, explain why you would want to know the answer to this
question.
c. For each question, explain how the answer leads to a predictive analysis
question.
d. For each question, describe the types of data transformation that would need to
take place (if any) to prepare the data for analysis.
e. For each question, identify the category of models (e.g. “a linear regression
model”) to answer the question.
f. For each question, justify your model selection.
6. Using complete sentences, fully complete the Predictive Analysis section with detailed
responses:
a. Identify at least 2 investigative questions that could be answered through a
predictive analysis of the dataset. Note: you may propose problems that would
require additional information not contained in the available data.
b. For each question, explain why you would want to know the answer to this
question.
c. For each question, describe the types of data transformation that would need to
take place (if any) to prepare the data for analysis.
d. For each question, identify the category of models (e.g. “a linear regression
model”) to answer the question.
e. For each question, justify your model selection
